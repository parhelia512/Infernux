/**
 * @file AsyncTransferContext.h
 * @brief Pooled, optionally-async upload pipeline backed by a dedicated
 *        transfer queue when the device exposes one.
 *
 * Designed as a thin successor to VkResourceManager::BeginSingleTimeCommands
 * / EndSingleTimeCommands. Where the latter always submits on the graphics
 * queue (and therefore steals throughput from the renderer), this context
 * routes work to the dedicated DMA queue advertised by modern discrete GPUs.
 *
 * Architectural shape (matches what UE5 / Frostbite / Unity HDRP do for
 * texture streaming):
 *
 *   * One VkCommandPool per worker thread (today: a single shared pool
 *     guarded by std::mutex; the per-thread split lands in Phase 5d once
 *     multi-threaded recording goes online).
 *   * Free-list pools of VkFence / VkCommandBuffer mirror the Phase 5b
 *     pattern in VkResourceManager so steady-state uploads hit zero
 *     kernel allocations.
 *   * Submission goes to the transfer queue if HasDedicatedTransferQueue();
 *     otherwise it transparently falls back to the graphics queue so call
 *     sites never need to branch.
 *
 * Queue family ownership transfer is the caller's responsibility. The
 * recommended pattern is documented on Begin/End below: emit a release
 * barrier with srcQueueFamilyIndex = transferFamily,
 * dstQueueFamilyIndex = graphicsFamily before EndAsync(), then on the
 * graphics queue (typically inside the next render frame) emit the
 * matching acquire barrier with the same family pair before the first
 * sample/draw that uses the resource.
