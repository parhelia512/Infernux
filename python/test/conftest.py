"""Shared fixtures for Infernux integration tests.

All tests use the real C++ backend (Infernux.lib). No fake/mock objects.

Session-scoped ``engine`` fixture (autouse) initialises Vulkan + SDL once for
the entire test run — every test executes with the real C++ engine running.
Per-function ``scene`` fixture creates a fresh Scene for each test.
